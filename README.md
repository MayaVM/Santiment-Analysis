# Sentiment-Analysis-ATIS

This is an exercise in model training for language data-sets. The notebook is divided into two parts:

1. Intent Classification using a general Model
2. Intent Classification using a known language model (in this case, BERT).

The code is an exercise of the tools learned in the "Intro to Deep Learning with PyTorch" course by udemy. The data-set used for this is the Kaggle "ATIS" data-set, containing travel requests and intent labeling (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hassanamin/atis-airlinetravelinformationsystem)

This file contains the jupyter notebook. Currently part 2 of the analysis is not up yet, it should be fixe by the end of the week.
