# Sentiment-Analysis-ATIS

This is an exercise in model training for language data-sets. The notebook is divided into two parts:

1. Intent Classification using a general Model
2. Intent Classification using a known language model (in this case, BERT).

The code is an exercise of the tools learned in the "Intro to Deep Learning with PyTorch" course by udemy. The data-set used for this is the Kaggle "ATIS" data-set, containing travel requests and intent labeling.

This file contains the jupyter notebook and the ATIS data set. Currently part 2 is not up yet, it should be fixe by the end of the week.
